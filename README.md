### Getting Started

It is recommend to use SmartBerry in a docker container. The easiest way to do so, is a deployment of SmartBerry via [balenaCloud](https://www.balena.io/cloud/). Just add the project to your balena applications and select a supported device. You also like to change the hostname of your device to `smartberry` - to do so, study these [notes](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/develop/runtime/#change-the-device-hostname).

[![balena deploy button](https://www.balena.io/deploy.svg)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https%3A//github.com/janwo/smartberry)

In order to adjust general settings of your SmartBerry instance, you may add the following environment variables.

### Configuration

To make SmartBerry manage your home in its full potential, some configuration is needed. Please also refer to the documentation of [openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/docs/).

#### Lights üí°

Lights are triggered automatically in dependence to daylight and presence changes. The following equipments and points are used for a proper lights configuration.

| Role                   | Needed equipment tags                                | Needed point tags             |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| Light switchable       | `Lightbulb` **or** `WallSwitch` **or** `PowerOutlet` | `Switch`                      |
| Light measurement item |                                                      | `Measurement` **and** `Light` |
| Astro Sun State        |                                                      | `CoreAstroSun`                |

Each location having "Light switchable" - items will receive the following items in order to adjust light configuration. To adjust the light management configuration, you can adjust the items accordingly.

| Item name     | Group membership                                               | Description                                                                                                             |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Autogenerated | `gCore_Lights_DarkMode` _and corresponding location group_     | Set the lighting mode in _dark_ conditions. Current choices are `OFF`, `ON `, `AUTO_ON` , `UNCHANGED` or `SIMULATE`     |
| Autogenerated | `gCore_Lights_ObscuredMode` _and corresponding location group_ | Set the lighting mode in _obscured_ conditions. Current choices are `OFF`, `ON `, `AUTO_ON` , `UNCHANGED` or `SIMULATE` |
| Autogenerated | `gCore_Lights_BrightMode` _and corresponding location group_   | Set the lighting mode in _bright_ conditions. Current choices are `OFF`, `ON `, `AUTO_ON` , `UNCHANGED` or `SIMULATE`   |

To adjust general configurations within the lights context, you can modify the following items.

| Item name                                                    | Description                                                                                                            |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Core_Lights_AmbientLightCondition                            | Identified light conditions                                                                                            |
| Core_Lights_AmbientLightCondition_LuminanceTreshold_Obscured | Upper luminance level for obscured light conditions                                                                    |
| Core_Lights_AmbientLightCondition_LuminanceTreshold_Dark     | Upper luminance level for dark light conditions                                                                        |
| Core_Lights_DefaultDuration                                  | Minutes without presence events until lights are turned off in `AUTO_ON ` mode.                                        |
| Core_Lights_WelcomeLight_DarkMode                            | Turn this on to turn on all light switchables in `AUTO_ON` mode during _dark_ light conditions when come back home     |
| Core_Lights_WelcomeLight_ObscuredMode                        | Turn this on to turn on all light switchables in `AUTO_ON` mode during _obscured_ light conditions when come back home |
| Core_Lights_WelcomeLight_BrightMode                          | Turn this on to turn on all light switchables in `AUTO_ON` mode during _bright_ light conditions when come back home   |

#### Heating üî•

Heating items are turned off automatically, if any Contact item is set to `ON` or `OPEN`. Additionally you can change all thermostats at once or via the default scene, see [default scene](#the-default-scene).

| Role                                                  | Needed equipment tags               | Needed point tags |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :---------------- |
| Contact item to adjust heating state                  | `Door ` **or** `Window `            | `OpenState`       |
| Thermostat mode item                                  | `RadiatorControl `                  | `SetPoint`        |
| Temperature measurement item (for visualisation only) | `Measurement` **and** `Temperature` |

To adjust the heating management configuration, you can adjust the following items accordingly.

| Item name                                          | Description                                                                                                |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Core_Heating_Thermostat_ModeDefault                | Set the heating mode. Current choices are `OFF`(0.0), `ON `(1.0), `ECO` (2.0) or `POWER` (3.0)             |
| Core_Heating_Thermostat_OpenContactShutdownMinutes | Minutes of any open contact until all heating items are turned off. Set to `0` to disable overall turn off |

In order to use a different command mapping for your thermostat, add the following metadata via `core` namespace to the thermostat mode item:

```
heating:
	command-map:
		"0.0": "0" [Send "0" to the thermostat mode item, if heating mode is OFF (0.0)]
		"1.0": "1"
		"2.0": "11"
		"3.0": "15"
```

#### Presence üëã

The presence management will automatically adjust the presence state in dependence to the last presence detection events. The following items are scoped.

| Role                  | Needed point tags |
| :-------------------- | :---------------- |
| Presence trigger item | `Presence`        |

To adjust the presence management configuration, you can adjust the following presence items.

| Item name                         | Description                                                                        |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Core_Presence                     | The actual presence state. Current choices are `HOME`, `AWAY_SHORT` or `AWAY_LONG` |
| Core_Presence_HoursUntilAwayShort | Set hours until presence management sets the presence state to `AWAY_SHORT`        |
| Core_Presence_HoursUntilAwayLong  | Set hours until presence management sets the presence state to `AWAY_LONG`         |

Presence items can also trigger absence events. To do so, add the desired state values via namespace `core` to the item with the `Presence` tag as shown below. By default, any `ON`-like state will trigger presence.

```
presence:
	absence-states: [optional, states that trigger absence, defaults to empty list]
		- "OFF"
	presence-states: [optional, states that trigger presence, defaults to "ON" and "OPEN"]
		- "ON"
		- "OPEN"
```

#### Scenes üé¨

Scenes allow multiple devices to be controlled with a single command. For example, in the "Arrival at home" scene, it is possible to switch on all lights and unlock the front door. The following items are scoped.

| Role               | Needed custom tags | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :----------------- | :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scene item         | `CoreScene`        | Add `options` to metadata via namespace `stateDescription` to add scene states, e.g. `options="0.0=Chillout,1.0=Party"`. When finished, trigger item `Core_Scenes_ReloadStates` to reinitialize all scene states. |
| Scene trigger item | `CoreSceneTrigger` | Manually changes the state of a given scene.                                                                                                                                                                      |

A scene saves all light switchable items within the same location (as defined in [lights](#lights)). You can change this behavior and use custom scene members by adding the list of items or groups to the metadata object of the scene item via namespace `core` and key `custom-members`. You can add `default:true` to include all default light switchable items.

To change the items states of the scene, each scene item has the following configuration items.

| Item name     | Group membership                                                | Description                                                                          |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Autogenerated | `gCore_Scenes_StoreTriggers` _and corresponding location group_ | Save the current states of all custom scene members as a scene state.                |
| Autogenerated | `gCore_Scenes_StateTriggers` _and corresponding location group_ | Scene trigger item that triggers one of the scene states as defined in its metadata. |

##### The default scene

In SmartBerry there is a preconfigured default scene named `Core_DefaultScene` with the states `PRESENT`, `AWAY_SHORT`, `AWAY_LONG` or `SLEEP` that applies to the following items and changes them accordingly:

| Item name                           | Description                           |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| Core_Security_OperationState        | See [security](#security) for details |
| Core_Heating_Thermostat_ModeDefault | See [heating](#heating) for details   |
| Core_Lights_DefaultDuration         | See [lights](#lights) for details     |
| Member of gCore_Lights_DarkMode     | See [lights](#lights) for details     |
| Member of gCore_Lights_BrightMode   | See [lights](#lights) for details     |
| Member of gCore_Lights_ObscuredMode | See [lights](#lights) for details     |

The default scene named `Core_DefaultScene` calls the context states `reset` and `sleep` upon activation of the `SLEEP` state.

##### Advanced scene features

Scenes can also react to context changes by changing its state value. To do so, add the desired state value to the context states via namespace `core`. The following examples adds the context state named `reset`. This way the scene state changes to `0.0` upon a call of `apply_context(>>sceneItem<<, 'reset')`.

```
scenes:
	context-states:
		reset: "0.0"
```

All needed scene trigger items are created by default. However, you can define custom scene trigger items. Just add the `CoreSceneTrigger` tag and define `trigger-state` in metadata namespace `core` as shown below.

```
scenes:
	trigger-state:
		target-scene: >>sceneItemName<<
		from: >>initialState<< [optional, only triggers if scene is in that state]
		to: >>newState<<
		states:  [optional]
			- "ON"
			- "OPEN"
```

#### Security üîí

The security system protects your home and responds to any unauthorized activity. The following items are scoped.

| Role                   | Needed equipment tags                              | Needed point tags           | Description                                                                            |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Assault trigger items  | `Window` **or** `Door` **or** `CoreAssaultTrigger` | `OpenState` **or** `Switch` | Items that trigger the alarm, if assault detection is activated                        |
| Assault Disarmer items | `CoreAssaultDisarmer`                              | `OpenState` **or** `Switch` | Items that disarm the assault detection, if item state updated to `ON ` or `OPEN`      |
| Lock closure items     | `CoreLockClosure`                                  | `OpenState` **or** `Switch` | Items that close a lock item within the same location, reacts to `OFF ` or `CLOSED`    |
| Lock items             | `Lock`                                             | `OpenState` **or** `Switch` | Lock items that may be closed by a door or window contact                              |
| Sirene items           |                                                    | `Alarm`                     | Items that are triggered after an assault detection, if assault detection is activated |

To adjust general configurations within the security context, you can modify the following items.

| Item name                    | Description                                                                                                 |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Core_Security_OperationState | Set the current assault detection state. Current choices are `OFF`, `SILENTLY` or `ON`.                     |
| Core_Security_SireneAutoOff  | Set minutes until the siren will turn off automatically. Set to zero to disable the auto-off functionality. |
