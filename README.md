## Getting Started

It is recommend to use SmartBerry in a docker container using `docker compose`. The easiest way to do so, is a deployment of SmartBerry via [balenaCloud](https://www.balena.io/cloud/). Just add the project to your balena applications and select a supported device. You also like to change the hostname of your device to `smartberry` - to do so, study these [notes](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/develop/runtime/#change-the-device-hostname).
